        <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>This is my coding <strong>training</strong> repository. Learing some of the basics of Git was quite a difficult challenge at first, partly because the program seemed so intimidating.</p>
            <p> Once I had gotten to grips with the basics, I really enjoyed practicing what I'd put in motion and the notion of being able to transfer work from git hub to my computer and vice versa was wonderful. It's definitely a tool I will make a lot of use of in the future and especially so in a coding capacity.</p>
            <p>The Git-It tutorial was really fascinating to learn. Admittedly, I will probably be relying more on GitHub than running commands in my terminal but it was interesting to learn how it could be done that way.</p>

        <p>I am practicing form-building along with making buttons and checkboxes. I found this a really useful thing to learn.</p>
